    <p class="col-9">The <strong>human brain</strong> is the main organ of the human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system" title="Nervous system">nervous system</a>. It is located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_head" title="Human head">head</a>, protected by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull" title="Human skull">skull</a>. It has the same general structure as the brains of other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, but with a more developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex" title="Cerebral cortex">cerebral cortex</a>. Large animals such as whales and elephants have larger brains in absolute terms, but when measured using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization_quotient" title="Encephalization quotient">measure of relative brain size</a>, which compensates for body size, the quotient for the human brain is almost twice as large as that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottlenose_dolphin" title="Bottlenose dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a>, and three times as large as that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>. Much of the size of the human brain comes from the cerebral cortex, especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe" title="Frontal lobe">frontal lobes</a>, which are associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions" title="Executive functions">executive functions</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control" title="Self-control">self-control</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning" title="Planning">planning</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reasoning</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction" title="Abstraction">abstract thought</a>. The area of the cerebral cortex devoted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception" title="Visual perception">vision</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex" title="Visual cortex">visual cortex</a>, is also greatly enlarged in humans compared to other animals.</p>
    <p class="col-9">The human cerebral cortex is a thick layer of <a href="/wiki/Nervous_tissue" title="Nervous tissue">neural tissue</a> that covers most of the brain. This layer is folded in a way that increases the amount of surface that can fit into the volume available. The pattern of folds is similar across individuals, although there are many small variations. The cortex is divided into four <a href="/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)" title="Lobe (anatomy)">lobes</a> – the <a href="/wiki/Frontal_lobe" title="Frontal lobe">frontal lobe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Parietal_lobe" title="Parietal lobe">parietal lobe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Temporal_lobe" title="Temporal lobe">temporal lobe</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Occipital_lobe" title="Occipital lobe">occipital lobe</a>. (Some classification systems also include a <a href="/wiki/Limbic_lobe" title="Limbic lobe">limbic lobe</a> and treat the <a href="/wiki/Insular_cortex" title="Insular cortex">insular cortex</a> as a lobe.) Within each lobe are numerous cortical areas, each associated with a particular function, including vision, <a href="/wiki/Motor_control" title="Motor control">motor control</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a>. The left and right sides of the cortex are broadly similar in shape, and most cortical areas are replicated on both sides. Some areas, though, show strong <a href="/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function" title="Lateralization of brain function">lateralization</a>, particularly areas that are involved in language. In most people, the left hemisphere is dominant for language, with the right hemisphere playing only a minor role. There are other functions, such as <a href="/wiki/Spatial_visualization_ability" title="Spatial visualization ability">visual-spatial ability</a>, for which the right hemisphere is usually dominant.</p>

    <p>Despite being protected by the thick bones of the skull, suspended in <a href="/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid" title="Cerebrospinal fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a>, and isolated from the <a href="/wiki/Circulatory_system" title="Circulatory system">bloodstream</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier" title="Blood–brain barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>, the human brain is susceptible to damage and disease. The most common forms of physical damage are <a href="/wiki/Closed_head_injury" title="Closed head injury">closed head injuries</a> such as a blow to the <a href="/wiki/Human_head" title="Human head">head</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a>, or poisoning by a variety of chemicals which can act as <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxin" title="Neurotoxin">neurotoxins</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol alcohol</a>. Infection of the brain, though serious, is rare because of the biological barriers which protect it. The human brain is also susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Neurodegeneration" title="Neurodegeneration">degenerative disorders</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease" title="Alzheimer's disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, (mostly as the result of <a href="/wiki/Aging_brain" title="Aging brain">aging</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis" title="Multiple sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>.

The brain can also be the site of <a href="/wiki/Brain_tumors" title="Brain tumors" class="mw-redirect">brain tumors</a> and these can be <a href="/wiki/Benign_tumour" title="Benign tumour" class="mw-redirect">benign</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="Cancer">malignant</a>.</p>
    <p>There are some techniques for studying the brain that are used in other animals that are just not suitable for use in humans and vice versa. It is easier to obtain individual brain cells taken from other animals, for <a href="/wiki/Histology" title="Histology">study</a>. It is also possible to use invasive techniques in other animals such as inserting electrodes into the brain or disabling certains parts of the brain in order to examine the effects on behaviour – techniques that are not possible to be used in humans. However, only humans can respond to complex verbal instructions or be of use in the study of important brain functions such as language and other complex cognitive tasks, but studies from humans and from other animals, can be of mutual help. <a href="/wiki/Medical_imaging" title="Medical imaging">Medical imaging</a> technologies such as <a href="/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging" title="Functional neuroimaging">functional neuroimaging</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electroencephalography" title="Electroencephalography">EEG</a> recordings are important techniques in studying the brain.
